```c++
#include <iostream>
```


```c++
std::cout << "Hello world!";
```

    Hello world!

# Comments

## Single line comment


```c++
int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
//    return 0;
}
```

## Multine comment


```c++
/*int main()
{
   std::cout << "Hello world!";
   return 0;
}
*/
```

# Variables

## Variable instantiation


```c++
int x;
std::cout << x;
```

    0

## multiple variables instantiation


```c++
int a, b, c;
```

## Variable assignment


```c++
float pi;
pi = 3.14;
```


```c++
float ex = 2.71;
```


```c++
float ex2(2);
```

## Uniform initialization in C++11

Unfortunately, direct initialization can’t be used for all types of initialization. In an attempt to provide a more consistent initialization mechanism, C++11 added a new syntax for direct initialization called brace initialization (also called uniform initialization) that uses curly braces:


```c++
int xyz{12};
```


```c++
int eg{ 9 }, fg{ 10 };
```

# iostream

## cout


```c++
std::cout << "Hello world!";
```

    Hello world!


```c++
int xyt = 4;
std::cout << xyt;
```

    4


```c++
std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
```

    Hello world!


```c++
int xzz{ 5 };
std::cout << "xzz is equal to: " << xzz;
```

    xzz is equal to: 5


```c++
int xyy{ 5 };
std::cout << "xyy is equal to: " << xyy << '\n';
std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n";
```

    xyy is equal to: 5
    And that's all, folks!


## cin


```c++
std::cout << "Enter a number: "; // ask user for a number
int xkk{ }; // define variable x to hold user input (and zero-initialize it)
std::cin >> xkk; // get number from keyboard and store it in variable x
std::cout << "You entered " << xkk << '\n';
```

    Enter a number: 14
    You entered 14



```c++

```
